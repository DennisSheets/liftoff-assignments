## Overview
The intent of this project is to provide a quasi prioritized to-do list for an emigrant who just arrived in the US. A new emigrant is likely a bit overwhelmed with everything that they need to do, should do, and could do. With a seemingly endless to-do list and so many complex resources available, the primary goal of this app is to provide an "aha moment" starting point with links to valuable and appropriate resources.

A user start on a welcome page where they will tell us what zip code they want this experience based on,what their preferred language is, and an emigration related news feed. From here, they will see a list of "Kneed to Knows" like "get an I-94#" and "Get a Work Permit". They will click on a selection which will take them to a page that has brief description, a link of relevant resources and if appropriate, Google Map of relevant locations with 250 miles".

An Admin will be able to login to add more admins, edit the content on each page and add new "Need to Knows".

## Features
#### User Login:  Admins will be able create additional Logins, update their profile, edit site content, and add new "Need to Knows".

### Google Maps API: If appropriate, a "Need to Know" page will include a Google Map
### Google Language API: On the landing page, a user will be able to set the language for the site.


### Technologies
Java

## What I'll Have to Learn
Our frontend team members would like to get away from Thymeleaf and start using React. Not only will some of us need to learn React, but we will also need to learn how to connect React with Java and what that means to MySQL.
We plan to host this site, so we need to determine an appropriate host, how to generate the appropriate files to upload to the host, and how to configure the host.
We need to learn the fundamentals of utilizing a RESTful API in Java, specifically the Google Maps API and an undetermined news source.
